## Use Cases
This would be for a max of a **few hundred students** in less than a **dozen spots** with maybe **1-2 buses per spot**. The buses have to be in the neighborhoods of kids to avoid having kids commute to the buses instead (e.g. if the buses were parked at a school lot and students need to drive up to it with parents to access).

**Wifi extenders** might be necessary to ensure complete coverage. The buses might need **GPS** capabilities to track buses for any reason. A local internet provider is essential  in order to have internet access. A partnership might be possible.

The wifi would **only be for school purposes** (e.g. no Netlfix or IG). This is to **minimize the load on the modem** (managing bandwidth) and to ensure kids are focused on school work. Would need to ensure that wifi is strong enough to stream video for Zoom. Can also have wifi only available during certain hours (e.g 8am-2pm) in order to minimize costs.

Wifi-buses enable schools to move expenses from transport budget to instructional budget. If a school bus serves a Title I school, funding can be used as it serves an instructional service. Additionally, buses can also double as a lunch delivery service for students on free or reduced lunch that donâ€™t have access to food which could further scale costs.
